The problem is spam classification problem, and the aim is to investigate and model different supervised machine learning methods to solve it.Various learning alorithms used are(with best accuracies):
| Classifier           | Accuracy      |
| ---------------------| --------------|
| Random Forest        | 0.95          |
| Logistic Regression  |  0.93         |
| Naive Bayes          | 0.81          |
| Linear SVM           |  0.89         |
